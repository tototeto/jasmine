				Dear Jasmine,
			</h3>
			<p>
				HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! You are an awesome person and such a great friend. I know this website is shit, but I felt like coding something by hand
				might come close to being an adequate gift for you. Of course I was wrong. Jasmine you are honestly just such a good person, like I don't
				really know what else to say. I would talk about what specifically about you is awesome, but it's difficult to do when literally everything
				about you is awesome. Anyways, here is a picture I made Sawyer send me:
