				Dear Jasmine,
			</h3>
			<p>
				HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!!! It's currently 10:29 pm, and as I was about to go to sleep I decided to continue this website
				for you. I'm sure you're doing extravagant and supremely over-the-top things for everyone else, so I owe you this and
				more. Anyways, seriously you're like the greatest person ever to be created by our good Christian lord, and you're always
				super awesome and nice to people. I can't thank you enough for always putting up with my shit, and tolerating my constant
				assholeishness. I hope you have a great Valentine's Day!

				Dear Jasmine,
			</h3>
			<p>
				HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! You are an awesome person and such a great friend. I know this website is shit, but I felt like coding something by hand
				might come close to being an adequate gift for you. Of course I was wrong. Jasmine you are honestly just such a good person, like I don't
				really know what else to say. I would talk about what specifically about you is awesome, but it's difficult to do when literally everything
				about you is awesome. Anyways, here is a picture I made Sawyer send me:
